# EduTrack Security & Deployment Guide

## 🔒 Security Measures Implemented

### Sensitive Files Removed
- ✅ `serviceAccountKey.json` - Firebase admin credentials (REMOVED)
- ✅ `.env.local` - Environment variables with API keys (REMOVED)
- ✅ Updated `.gitignore` to prevent future commits of sensitive files

### Environment Variables Required for Production

Create a `.env.local` file (not committed to git) with these variables:

```bash
# Firebase Configuration (Client-side - safe for frontend)
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.firebasestorage.app
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
```

### For GitHub Pages Deployment

Since GitHub Pages doesn't support server-side environment variables, you'll need to:

1. **Option A: Use GitHub Secrets**
   - Add Firebase config as GitHub repository secrets
   - Use GitHub Actions to inject them during build

2. **Option B: Public Firebase Config**
   - Firebase client config is safe to be public
   - Can be hardcoded for production deployment
   - Only contains public identifiers, not secrets

## 🚀 Production Deployment Steps

1. **Set up Firebase project** with proper security rules
2. **Configure GitHub repository secrets** (if using GitHub Actions)
3. **Build and deploy** to GitHub Pages
4. **Verify security** - no sensitive data in deployed files

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices Applied

- ✅ No private keys in repository
- ✅ No admin credentials in client code
- ✅ Environment variables for configuration
- ✅ Proper `.gitignore` for sensitive files
- ✅ Firebase security rules in place
- ✅ Client-side authentication only

## 📝 Notes

- Firebase client config (API keys, project IDs) are safe to be public
- They only identify your Firebase project, not authenticate admin access
- Real security comes from Firebase security rules and server-side validation
