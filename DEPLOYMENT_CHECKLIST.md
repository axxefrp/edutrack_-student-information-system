# 🚀 EduTrack Liberian SIS - Deployment Checklist

## ✅ **Pre-Deployment Verification**

### **Repository Setup**
- [ ] Repository is public (or has GitHub Pro/Team for private repos)

- [ ] Save configuration
- [ ] Note the deployment URL format: `https://[username].github.io/edutrack_-student-information-system/`

### **Optional: Firebase Configuration**
If you want real authentication (not demo mode):
- [ ] Go to repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Build Fails**
**Symptoms**: Red X in Actions, build errors in logs
**Solutions**:
1. Check Actions logs for specific error messages
2. Verify all dependencies are in package.json
3. Ensure TypeScript compilation passes locally: `npm run type-check`
4. Test build locally: `npm run build:github`

### **Site Loads but Appears Broken**
**Symptoms**: White screen, missing styling, JavaScript errors
**Solutions**:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify base URL configuration in vite.config.ts
3. Ensure all assets are loading from correct paths
4. Check that GitHub Pages is serving from correct branch

### **Cultural Elements Missing**
**Symptoms**: Generic styling instead of Liberian design
**Solutions**:
1. Verify liberianDesignSystem.css is included in build
2. Check that CSS custom properties are loading
3. Ensure Tailwind configuration includes Liberian colors
4. Verify dark mode toggle is functioning

### **Firebase Features Not Working**
**Symptoms**: Authentication errors, data not loading
**Solutions**:
1. Check if Firebase secrets are configured in repository settings
2. Verify Firebase project configuration
3. Ensure Firebase rules allow public access if needed
4. Application will work in demo mode without Firebase
